\section{Introduction}

Make some citations: \cite{Parker1973} or \citep{Parker1973}.
The following is just filler text.
\lipsum[1-4]


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Methods}

Examples of equations in eq.~\ref{eq:linear_least_squares} and figures in
fig.~\ref{fig:example}.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{\hat{p}} =
    \left(\mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{A}\right)^{-1}
    \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{d^o}
  % Label used to reference the equation in the text.
  \label{eq:linear_least_squares}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  % Width should be \columnwidth for a single column
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/tesseroid-coord-sys.png}
  \caption{
    This is the figure caption. Notice that the figure number is inserted into
    the text automatically. After \citet{uieda2015}.
  }
  % Label used to reference the figure in the text.
  \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}

Example of a 2 column figure (avoid these if you can):
fig.~\ref{fig:example_fullpage}.
\lipsum[4]

\begin{figure*}[!htb]
  % Width should be \textwidth for full page figures
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/example-spline-interpolation.png}
  \caption{
    Another figure with full page width. Avoid these if you can since they are
    tricky to place in the text.
  }
  % Label used to reference the figure in the text.
