\chapter{Introduction}

YOUR INTRODUCTION. The citations and bibliography are automatically handled by
BibTeX and the \texttt{natbib} package. Place the bibliographic information for
the references in the \texttt{references.bib} file and then cite your
references in the text (see below). The References section will be generated
automatically. To get the bibliographic information for papers, use the
\url{https://www.doi2bib.org/} website (DOIs are unique identifiers for
scientific publications, datasets, etc; you can find them in the paper PDFs or
publisher websites).

This is how you make citations: in the text \cite{Parker1973} or with
parenthesis \citep{Parker1973}. See
\url{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_citation_styles} for more
information.

The following is just filler text.
